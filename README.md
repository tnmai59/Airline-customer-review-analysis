# Data-and-sentiment-analysis
In this project, I will analyze factors affect decisions to promote airline of customers and do some sentiment analysis base on the reviews.

The data is crawled from Skytrax, which is a verified airline review website. From this website, I crawled 2 datasets:
- review_stats_data.csv: Including all ratings point of customers for their flight
- review_text_data.csv: Including the reviews of customers for their flight.

This is my very first project. It is naive and it has many shortcomings. Yet, I still proud of it and looking for improvement in the future.
