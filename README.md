# Data-and-sentiment-analysis
In this project, I will analyze factors affect decisions to promote airline of customers and do some sentiment analysis base on the reviews.

The data is crawled from Skytrax, which is a verified airline review website. From this website, I crawled 2 datasets:
- review_stats_data.csv: Including all ratings point of customers for their flight
- review_text_data.csv: Including the reviews of customers for their flight.

This is my very first project. It is made with purpose to practice my knowledge of Statistics, Programming, Machine Learning and NLP.
That is why the Machine Learning model used in this project is implemented from scratch.

This project is naive and it has many shortcomings. Yet, I am still learning and looking for improvement in the future.
